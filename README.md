  have contributed in various deployments of projects and implementation of new services at organization level
  in my previous roles.

- I am interested in Project management and Data Science Roles as I am very passionate in helping technical 
and business teams in implementing various projects. :smiley:

- I’m currently pursuing Masters in Business Analytics, at Hult International Business School, where I have 
been able to learn and work on Python, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Visualization and DataCamp certified in 
Unsupervised and Supervised Learning techniques.

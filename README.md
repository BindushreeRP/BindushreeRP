Hello, I am @BindushreeRP
- I am from Bengaluru, India, where I have completed a Masters 
  Degree in Chemical Engineering and worked with IT majors like Capgemini and Accenture for about 4.5 years 
  before moving to Boston, US. I have immense knowledge and experience with O365 Collaboration Services and 
  have contributed in various deployments of projects and implementation of new services at organization level
  in my previous roles.
- I am interested in Project management and Data Science Roles as I am very passionate in helping technical 
and business teams in implementing various projects. 
- I’m currently pursuing Masters in Business Analytics, at Hult International Business School, where I have 
been able to learn and work on Python, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Visualization and certified in 
Unsupervised and Supervised Learning techniques.
- I’m looking to collaborate with organizations and teams that are looking to organise and optimize their platforms, 
help with project management with Data Science or technological roles within O365.
